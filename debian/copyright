      CREATIVE COMMONS CORPORATION IS NOT A LAW FIRM AND DOES NOT PROVIDE
      LEGAL SERVICES. DISTRIBUTION OF THIS DOCUMENT DOES NOT CREATE AN
      ATTORNEY-CLIENT RELATIONSHIP. CREATIVE COMMONS PROVIDES THIS
      INFORMATION ON AN "AS-IS" BASIS. CREATIVE COMMONS MAKES NO WARRANTIES
      REGARDING THE USE OF THIS DOCUMENT OR THE INFORMATION OR WORKS
      PROVIDED HEREUNDER, AND DISCLAIMS LIABILITY FOR DAMAGES RESULTING FROM
      THE USE OF THIS DOCUMENT OR THE INFORMATION OR WORKS PROVIDED
      HEREUNDER.
  .
  Statement of Purpose
  .
  The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer
  exclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon the creator
  and subsequent owner(s) (each and all, an "owner") of an original work of
  authorship and/or a database (each, a "Work").
  .
  Certain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a Work for
  the purpose of contributing to a commons of creative, cultural and
  scientific works ("Commons") that the public can reliably and without fear
  of later claims of infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in other
  works, reuse and redistribute as freely as possible in any form whatsoever
  and for any purposes, including without limitation commercial purposes.
  These owners may contribute to the Commons to promote the ideal of a free
  culture and the further production of creative, cultural and scientific
  works, or to gain reputation or greater distribution for their Work in
  part through the use and efforts of others.
  .
  For these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any
  expectation of additional consideration or compensation, the person
  associating CC0 with a Work (the "Affirmer"), to the extent that he or she
  is an owner of Copyright and Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily
  elects to apply CC0 to the Work and publicly distribute the Work under its
  terms, with knowledge of his or her Copyright and Related Rights in the
  Work and the meaning and intended legal effect of CC0 on those rights.
  .
  1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be
  protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights ("Copyright and
  Related Rights"). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not
  limited to, the following:
  .
    i. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display,
       communicate, and translate a Work;
   ii. moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);
  iii. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person's image or
       likeness depicted in a Work;
   iv. rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work,
       subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(a), below;
    v. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data
       in a Work;
   vi. database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the
       European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal
       protection of databases, and under any national implementation
       thereof, including any amended or successor version of such
       directive); and
  vii. other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the
       world based on applicable law or treaty, and any national
       implementations thereof.
  .
  2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention
  of, applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently,
  irrevocably and unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of
  Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights and associated claims and causes
  of action, whether now known or unknown (including existing as well as
  future claims and causes of action), in the Work (i) in all territories
  worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by applicable law or
  treaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or future
  medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever,
  including without limitation commercial, advertising or promotional
  purposes (the "Waiver"). Affirmer makes the Waiver for the benefit of each
  member of the public at large and to the detriment of Affirmer's heirs and
  successors, fully intending that such Waiver shall not be subject to
  revocation, rescission, cancellation, termination, or any other legal or
  equitable action to disrupt the quiet enjoyment of the Work by the public
  as contemplated by Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.
  .
  3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason
  be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the
  Waiver shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into
  account Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the
  extent the Waiver is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected
  person a royalty-free, non transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive,
  irrevocable and unconditional license to exercise Affirmer's Copyright and
  Related Rights in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the
  maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future
  time extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number
  of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without
  limitation commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the
  "License"). The License shall be deemed effective as of the date CC0 was
  applied by Affirmer to the Work. Should any part of the License for any
  reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, such
  partial invalidity or ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder
  of the License, and in such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she
  will not (i) exercise any of his or her remaining Copyright and Related
  Rights in the Work or (ii) assert any associated claims and causes of
  action with respect to the Work, in either case contrary to Affirmer's
  express Statement of Purpose.
  .
  4. Limitations and Disclaimers.
  .
   a. No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned,
      surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this document.
   b. Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or
      warranties of any kind concerning the Work, express, implied,
      statutory or otherwise, including without limitation warranties of
      title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non
      infringement, or the absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or
      the present or absence of errors, whether or not discoverable, all to
      the greatest extent permissible under applicable law.
   c. Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other persons
      that may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including without
      limitation any person's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work.
      Further, Affirmer disclaims responsibility for obtaining any necessary
      consents, permissions or other rights required for any use of the
      Work.
   d. Affirmer understands and acknowledges that Creative Commons is not a
      party to this document and has no duty or obligation with respect to
      this CC0 or use of the Work.
